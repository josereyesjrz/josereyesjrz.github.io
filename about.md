I’m a Computer Science student, currently at the [University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus.](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/2016/wordpress/)

I like wacky regexes, interesting programming languages, and arguing about comics on the internet.

I’ll be posting about CS stuff, tech news, and (probably more than anything else) about comics.

Interesting links are welcome. Send them by [email](mailto:josreyes53@gmail.com) or to my Twitter, [@jrz53](https://twitter.com/jrz53).
