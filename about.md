I’m a Computer Science student, currently at the [University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus.](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/2016/wordpress/)

I love functional languages, wacky regexes, and arguing about comics on the internet.

I’ll be posting about CS stuff, tech news, and (probably more than I should) about comics.

Interesting links are welcome. Send them by [email](mailto:josreyes53@gmail.com) or to my Twitter, [@jrz53](https://twitter.com/jrz53).
