title:  "Going to Racket Summer School 2018"
---
Good news! I'm attending the [2018 Racket Summer School](https://summer-school.racket-lang.org/2018/)!
Quite exciting to finally get the chance to take part in an extracurricular summer event, especially
this summer being my last at university.

Language design and functional languages are some of my biggest Computer Science interests so I'm really
looking forward to the experience. Knowing that [Matthew Butterick](https://mbtype.com/bio.html), author
of [Beautiful Racket](https://beautifulracket.com/) will be teaching at the summer school is icing on the cake.
